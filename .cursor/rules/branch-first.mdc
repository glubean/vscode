# Branch-First Workflow

**Before editing ANY file in this repository, you MUST:**

1. Run `git fetch origin main` to get the latest remote state
2. Run `git checkout -b <branch-name> origin/main` to create a new branch from remote main
3. Only then start making changes

This applies even if the user says "do it", "fix it", "make the change", etc. Never edit files while on `main`.

## Branch naming

- Bug fix: `fix/<short-description>`
- Feature: `feat/<short-description>`
- Docs: `docs/<short-description>`
- Chore: `chore/<short-description>`

## Exceptions

- If the user explicitly says to work on an existing branch (e.g., "continue on branch X"), switch to that branch instead.
- If you are already on a feature branch (not `main`), you may continue working on it.

## How to check

Run `git branch --show-current` first. If the output is `main`, you MUST create a new branch before editing.
