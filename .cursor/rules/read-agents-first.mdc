# Read AGENTS.md First

Before doing ANY work in this repository, you MUST read `/AGENTS.md` at the project root.

This file contains:
- Coding standards and conventions
- Git workflow rules (strict GitHub Flow)
- Permission requirements for git operations

Do not skip this step. Do not assume you know the contents. Read it every time.
